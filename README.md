# RoadOptimization

RoadOptimization is a submission for uOttaHack 5, utilizing Java and JavaScript to simulate an algorithm that determines the optimal routes for postal trucks to deliver parcels. The algorithm takes multiple variables into account, including weather and road conditions, to ensure efficient and effective delivery routes.

## Features

- **Algorithm Simulation:** Simulates a route optimization algorithm for postal trucks.
- **Multi-variable Consideration:** Takes into account various factors such as weather and road conditions.
- **Java and JavaScript Implementation:** Developed using Java for backend logic and JavaScript for frontend simulation.
- **No Frameworks:** Built with pure HTML, CSS, and Java/JavaScript without the use of specific frameworks.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** Used for the backend logic and algorithm implementation.
- **JavaScript:** Powers the frontend simulation of the optimization algorithm.
- **HTML and CSS:** Basic web technologies for structuring and styling the application.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/RoadOptimization.git
    ```

2. **Open the project:**

    Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.

3. **Run the simulation:**

    Execute the Java backend to start the simulation algorithm.

4. **Explore the simulation:**

    Open the HTML file in a web browser to visualize the algorithm simulation.
